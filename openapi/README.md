# OpenAPI bundle

`bundled.yaml` is honeybadger's generated v3 bundle (`bin/rails openapi:bundle`),
copied by `make update-spec`. Don't edit it: fix the spec in honeybadger, then
copy the new bundle into every downstream project (api-go, docs, this provider).

The sha256 identifies the bundle. In honeybadger the bundle is a generated,
gitignored file, so the branch and commit identify only the source
definitions it was built from.
